IoniConnect.UsageExample
========

The `IoniConnect.API` is at the heart of the AME2.0 system. It can be called by clients to 
interact with all parts of the AME system, such as start/stop a measurement, run an action,
fetch the latest data or even load spectra and HDF5 files.

The API is designed as a RESTful API and can be used from any HTTP-capable client. This
project is focussed on .NET (supporting .NET Standard 2.0 and thus a wide range of applications).
For Python support see the `PyTRMS` Python package.

Feel free to [contact Ionicon](mailto:software@ionicon.com) with any questions. The API is
in active development and documentation is very limited, but gladly provided if there's 
enhanced interest.
